Push-Up; images/pushup.png; Uses your arms to repeatedly push up off the floor and slowly go back down again; Get on the floor on all fours, positioning your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. Extend your legs back so that you are balanced on your hands and toes. Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe without sagging in the middle or arching your back. You can position your feet to be close together or a bit wider depending on what is most comfortable for you.
; Sit-Up; images/situp.png; Uses your abominal muscles and your core to lift your upper body off the ground and back again; Start by lying on your back with your knees bent. Sit ups work best if you do them on a soft surface, such as a mattress. Keep your knees bent at a 90-degree angle, with your feet flat on the floor. You may be more comfortable if you lie on an exercise mat while youâ€™re doing sit ups.
